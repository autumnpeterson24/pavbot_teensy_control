HEY FIYA! Here are some of your next steps:

What your side currently looks like now: 

1. cmd_vel_to_axes (/teensy/axes) ~the skeleton we have right now

2. teensy_serial_transport (not yet written)
    * serial communication

3. Teensy 4.1 firmware (I2C)

4. DAC (2-channel) (We will need this as extra)

5. Wheelchair joystick input

TASK 1: =============
Turn the stub into something that looks like real hardware, even if nothing is connected

Create a new node:

    teensy_serial_transport.cpp

It should:
    - subscribe to /teensy/axes

    - Parse forward and turn

    - Convert them into fixed-point integers (example: int16_t)

    - Print what would be sent over serial
    ** an example output would be: TX: fwd=1234 turn=-532

* Deliverable: A node that logs “TX frames” at ~20 Hz.
